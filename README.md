## Introduction

- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for working with relational databases. 

- It's a fundamental skill for data professionals and plays a crucial role in data manipulation, analysis, and reporting. 

- This repository aims to provide a structured learning path for SQL through Jupyter notebooks, making it easier to grasp and apply SQL concepts effectively.

Each notebook provides explanations, examples, and hands-on exercises to help you understand and practice SQL concepts.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command :
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheMrityunjayPathak/SQLforDataScience.git
````

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the desired notebook file :

````bash
jupyter notebook
````

3. Follow along with the Notebook and run the code in SQL Enviroment to explore the concepts and examples.

## How To

1. Download the [Parch and Posey](https://github.com/TheMrityunjayPathak/SQLforDataScience/blob/main/Parch%20and%20Posey.sql) SQL File

2. Go to an online SQL Compiler, such as [SQLiteOnline](https://sqliteonline.com/).

3. Import the Parch and Posey.sql file and run the queries to practice SQL concepts.

## Entity Relationship Diagram

In the Parch & Posey Database there are 5 tables :

- web_events
- accounts
- orders
- sales_reps
- region
